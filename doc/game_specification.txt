Blotto v2 Game Specification
============================

The Game Design
---------------

These are the parameters for setting up games. See glossary for definitions.

Game type

    Set by an appropriate flavour of configuration file.
      * Normal (standard organisations only)
      * Superdraw (RBE organisations only)

Draw scheduling

    Draw date is, by definition, always the day after the draw close date
    Draw execution time should be early morning after all data is available:
      * payment data up to and including the draw close date
      * external number-match providers (for example lotto.de Spiel 77 Saturday
        pm)
    Draw schedule is defined by per-organisation bespoke functions

Draw entrants

    Normal games calculate player balances to identify draw entrants.
    Superdraw games use bespoke rules to find draw entrants from multiple
    standard games.

Prize level

    Prize definitions are in `blotto_prize`.
    `level` is an integer that references and orders distinct prize
    definitions.
    Only one prize definition per level is currently active.
    There is no limit to the number of prize levels.
    Prize levels do not need to be contiguous.

Prize name

    A human-readable name for each prize definition, for example:
      Level | Name
      ------------
        1   | Superduper Potty Lotto
        3   | Deuxième prix
        6   | The Wooden Spoon Award

Prize type

    Supported prize types:
      * Raffle
      * Number-match 
    Different prize types may be mixed within any given game.

    Each prize definition has a start date and an active switch.
    The current definition for a given prize level is one that is:
      * both active
      * and:
          - either has one or more rollovers currently in play
          - or, if none are in play, has the latest start date on or before the
            draw date.

    Each prize definition has one of the following reward types:
     * Fixed cash prize amount [blotto_prize.amount]
     * Calculated cash prize using a prize amount function
       [blotto_prize.amount_function] used to calculate the prize based on a 
       bespoke calculation with parameters such as the number of tickets in the
       draw, if there is an "r" in the month, etc etc. Prize amount functions
       should not contain hard-wired numeric values; they should be abstracted
       as constants such as:
         define ('BLOTTO_PRIZE_1_PERCENT', 30);
       This could mean something like "First prize is 30% of the draw revenue".
     * Free ticket prizes [blotto_prize.ticket_quantity,
       blotto_prize.ticket_num_of_draws]
     * Non-cash prizes such as "new Ford Ka", "cuddly toy" or "supper with Evan Davies"

Raffle properties

    Configured as blotto_prize.level_method = 'RAFF':
      * number of winners at this prize level - blotto_prize.quantity

    Mean win per draw_entrant is a function of:
      * the quantity of wins per prize definition
      * the number of draw entrants

    Mean prize payout per draw is a fixed quantity provided there are at least
    as many draw entrants as available wins.

Number-match properties

    Configured as (for example) blotto_prize.level_method = '7LR1':
      * First digit = number of digits to match
      * L = try matching from the left
      * R = try matching from the right
      * Last digit is the number-match group
      * One random number is drawn per group
      * Number-match may be:
          - perfect eg. 6LR1 in a 6-digit ticket pool
          - partial eg. 7LR2 in an 8-digit ticket pool

    Mean win per draw_entrant is a function of:
      * the range of the ticket pool

    Mean prize payout per draw is a function of:
      * the range of the ticket pool
      * the number of draw entrants

    Rollovers are a number-match-only feature.
      * Zero or more rollovers allowed - blotto_prize.rollovers_max
      * Maximum payout may be capped in fewer rollovers - blotto_prize.rollover_cap

Ticket pool

    [Is there something that needs saying about choice/size of ticket pool in
    terms of game design?]



The Draw Process
----------------

Raffle prizes

    Raffle prizes may have multiple winners at multiple levels. Prize level is
    determined by the order of selection of the total required number of
    tickets. For example a game defined with one first prize and three second
    prizes would be drawn in the sequence:
        "Prize 1", "Prize 2", "Prize 2", "Prize 2".

Number-match prizes

    Number-match prizes are organised in groups.
    A single random number is selected ly selected ticket from the ticket pool regardless of
    whether or not it has been issued to a player.



Example games
=============

These examples are supported by the above specification which states that each prize can be redefined (or deactivated) for the next draw provided the current rollover value is zero.

Therefore the prize definitions below should be viewed as "current settings".
