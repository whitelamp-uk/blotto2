See cumulative distribution function (CDF).

If one were to randomly pick a CDF y-axis value and look up the x-axis value,
one would have a fluctuating number of winners with a consistent mean quantity
per week but with a binomial random deviation.

Inputs:
* $cdf  randomly selected value between 0 and 1
* $ts   number of tickets
* $pb   probability per binomial trial (fixed odds)
* $wa   expected number of winners $p*$tk

Derived:
* $wn   simulated number of winners - a "noisy" value

             |
   expected $wa

From here on behaves like a regular raffle prize...
