Chance - the entitlement of one ticket number in any one draw.

Draw - periodic process of running the game having an organisation-bespoke
schedule.

Draw entrant - a single ticket/chance in a given draw.

Game - activity that takes place inside an organisation database.

Game model - the algorithms by which draw entrants holding well-defined ticket
numbers and random number generation processes result in prizes with well-
defined values. Game models are primarily defined by:
  * The draw schedule
  * Current prize attributes
  * Choice of ticket pool with consideration of:
     - ticket size
     - private or shared with other organisation(s)

Number-match - see prize type

Organisation - entity that runs a game (organisation:game is 1:1)
  * Standard - type of organisation that gets money from players and runs normal
    draws.
  * RBE organisation - Rule Based Entry organisations have contractual rules
    agreed with multiple standard organisations to accept entries into
    superdraws and return winners data.

Pool size - see ticket pool

Prize - an ephemeral definition of a lottery prize. *Current* prizes are defined
uniquely by prize level. Prize level defines the human ordering of the prizes in
a draw. Normal raffle prizes may be defined to produce one or more winners. By
definition the quantity of number-match winners cannot be known.

Prize type - fundamental prize characteristic:
  * Number-match - awarded by comparing ticket numbers with a drawn number
    (unpredictable number of winners)
     - Perfect number-match
     - Partial number-match
  * Raffle - awarded by drawing a selection of held tickets (guaranteed number
    of winners)
     - Normal
     - Ad hoc (only happens in order to end a rollover)

Raffle - see prize type

Rollover - The accumulated value of a number-match prize that was not won in one
or more previous draws. By definition, only number-match prizes (see prize type)
can have rollover properties:
  * Maximum rollovers - the greatest number of times the prize may be carried
    forward before it becomes an ad noc raffle.
  * Rollover cap - the greatest permitted value of the prize.

RBE organisation - see organisation

Standard organisation - see organisation

Superdraw - a draw that:
  * may only be run by RBE organisations
  * does not deduct funds from players
  * derives draw entrants from multiple standard organisations
  * bases draw entry on bespoke per-organisation rules [1]
  * must use a private ticket pool

Ticket - A single number from a ticket pool

Ticket holder - usually synonymous with a player but might be a "lower" pool
allowing a third party application to hold a buffer of tickets to issue to
players later.

Ticket pool - a ticket range of zero-padded-left positive integers where the
length of highest integer decides the length of all the tickets. When the data
for a ticket is created, it is issued to a ticket holder. Only one ticket holder
is allowed per ticket (see ticket holder).


 1. RBE bespoke PHP invokes processes for each of its client organisations so no
    repetition is required if the rules are common.
